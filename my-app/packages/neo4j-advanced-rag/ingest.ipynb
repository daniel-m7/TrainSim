Enjoy!\\nWe are happy to accommodate certain modiﬁcations but they may incur an additional charge\\nI opened Mama Ricotta’s in August of 1992 to offer the delicious homestyle Italian-American food I remember fondly from \\nmy youth. Back in 1908, my grandfather emigrated from Quindice, Italy to Springﬁeld, Massachusetts to ﬁnd work as a \\nstonemason. He settled in Springﬁeld’s South End, an ethnic neighborhood full of immigrants from all regions of Italy. Over \\nthe years, natives of Naples, Calabria, Marche, Bari, and other regions joined our extended family through marriages and \\nfriendships. I have chosen a regional Italian-American menu at Mama Ricotta’s because it reﬂects my family’s expansive \\nand diverse heritage.\\nWe serve my interpretation of the dishes prepared by relatives and friends, who loved nothing more than to get together \\nto share new recipes and to perfect old favorites. The food here is created with the same passion and adventurous spirit I \\nsaw every day in my family’s kitchen. Maybe it goes without saying, but family and friends deserve only the best. It was \\ntrue when I was a boy in Springﬁeld, and it’s true every time a guest walks through the door of Mama Ricotta’s. We seek \\nout the ﬁnest and freshest ingredients from across the globe, and hold the highest standards for our homemade \\nmozzarella, sausage, breads, and desserts. One dish at a time, it’s my pleasure to continue a rich tradition of quality, \\ncreativity and warm hospitality.\\nWelcome to Mama Ricotta\\n’s\\nSo please relax and enjoy. We’re glad to have you here.\\nFrank Scibelli\\nRestaurant | P. 704.343.0148 \\nCatering | P. 704.343.0155\\n601 South Kings Drive • Suite AA \\nCharlotte, NC 28204\\n\")]\n"
