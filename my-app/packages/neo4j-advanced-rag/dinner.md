## Welcome to Mama Ricotta’s

I opened Mama Ricotta’s in August of 1992 to offer the delicious homestyle Italian-American food I remember fondly from

my youth. Back in 1908, my grandfather emigrated from Quindice, Italy to Springfield, Massachusetts to find work as a

stonemason. He settled in Springfield’s South End, an ethnic neighborhood full of immigrants from all regions of Italy. Over

the years, natives of Naples, Calabria, Marche, Bari, and other regions joined our extended family through marriages and

friendships. I have chosen a regional Italian-American menu at Mama Ricotta’s because it reflects my family’s expansive

and diverse heritage.

We serve my interpretation of the dishes prepared by relatives and friends, who loved nothing more than to get together

to share new recipes and to perfect old favorites. The food here is created with the same passion and adventurous spirit I

saw every day in my family’s kitchen. Maybe it goes without saying, but family and friends deserve only the best. It was

true when I was a boy in Springfield, and it’s true every time a guest walks through the door of Mama Ricotta’s. We seek

out the finest and freshest ingredients from across the globe, and hold the highest standards for our homemade

mozzarella, sausage, breads, and desserts. One dish at a time, it’s my pleasure to continue a rich tradition of quality,

creativity and warm hospitality.

##### So please relax and enjoy. We’re glad to have you here.
